# Key Mappings
# ------------
# Major headings define whether you are specifying a kind of ``input'' or a
# kind of ``target''. It is possible to have multiple input and target
# types. These keys are used when describing events below.

input:
  i: "phon"
  w:
    sem: "warmstart"
target:
  t: "sem"

# Event Descriptions
# ------------------
# It is possible to define multiple event schemas, so the first field under
# the ``events'' major heading is going to be a ``schema label''. Within a
# schema, decribe a series of events in terms of the input and target types
# defined above. Associating and I/O type with a 1 means to use the I/O
# values expressed in the example file. Associating an I/O type with 0
# means to feed zeros into the I/O units associtated with that type.
# Associating an I/O type with a "-" indicates that the units should not be
# stimulated at all.
